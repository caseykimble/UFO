# UFO - The Truth is Out There

### Overview of Project

The purpose of this project was to use JavaScript and HTML basics to build a website that enables visitors to review table data on UFO sighting reports, with a handy filter built in using JavaScript arrays to search by date, state, city, country and type (shape) of sighting. A section was also built in so that visitors can read a snippet from a UFOlogist about UFO sightings.

### Results

The result of this project is a website with a clean, simple design and built-in search functions so visitors are able to review specific information related to our JavaScript arrays without having to browse the entire table. Visitors are able to search by specific dates, cities, states, countries and shapes of UFO sightings to learn more about them. The search fields are available on the left side of the page where users can input a single parameter and narrow down the table.
